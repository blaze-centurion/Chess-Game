# Chess Game In Pygame

This is the basic offine multiplayer chess game with basic rules and regulation. This game does not contain any online multiplayer, setting different colors and board, ai player feature.
This is my basic practice project for learning pygame.



## Tech Used
- Pygame - 2.0.1
## How to run.

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/blaze-centurion/chess-game.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd chess-game-master
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  python install pygame
```

Start the main file

```bash
  python main.py
```

If you want this file to refresh automatically after saving the file. Then you can use nodemon.

Install nodemon
```bash
  node i nodemon
```

Run main.py
```bash
  nodemon --exec python main.py
```

*Note*: *There can be some bug in this game. So please let me know if you find some bug. I will try to fix it. And I will improve this game in future.*
